<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>
My name is Tim Lamberton.
I am a <strong>researcher and programmer</strong>
with a background in physics, maths and bioinformatics. 
I have <strong>developed and maintained open-source software</strong>
for bioinformatics,
and <strong>designed and implemented novel algorithms</strong>
for clustering genomic sequence data.
I <strong>designed and implemented an experimental programming language</strong>,
which aims to be easy to learn and easy to use.
I have <strong>developed website front- and back-ends</strong>,
and standalone web applications.
This website contains information on my past and present work,
as well as programming-related writing, demos and other things.
Have a look around!
