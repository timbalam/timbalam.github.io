<h1>Making a programming language</h1>

<p>
This article discusses my motivation for making <strong>Goat</strong>, 
a new programming language.
To find out about the language itself,
some good places to start are the beginner's introduction at <a href="learn">Learn</a>,
or the <a href="examples">Examples</a>. 
</p>

<p> 
<strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong>
Goat is very incomplete!
It is missing a lot of the features that you would generally find in a useful programming language.
If you want to "get stuff done",
I would recommend looking at the many popular languages that are out there.
</p>

<p>
Computer programs are powerful tools for automation.
As programmers,
our task is to explain to the computer how to do what we want.
For this we use programming languages.
</p>

<p>
Programming languages have greatly increased our ability to write complex programs.
But why do they work?
How does the computer make sense of something that looks so close to written language.
Computers —
What do they do?
Do they do things?
Let's find out!
</p>

<p>
I made a programming language "Goat" to experiment with some ideas I have for a small,
readable language that won't let you down as you build out more and more complex systems. 
</p>

<p>
Goat is still a work in progress and it remains to be seen whether it will live up to these lofty ideals.
</p>

<p>
An ambition I have for Goat is that it be a language suitable for beginners and non-programmers.
Learning Goat shouldn't require previous experience with other programming languages —
Goat is described thoroughly in its own terms in the <a href="learn">beginners introduction</a> and the <a href="examples">examples</a>.
If I've got you curious to know more, these are the places to go next!
