<h1>Making a programming language</h1>

<p>
This article discusses the motivation I have for making a new programming language,
which I am calling <strong>Goat</strong>.
If you're looking to find out about the language itself,
some good places to start are the beginner's introduction at <a href="learn">Learn</a>,
or the <a href="examples">Examples</a>,
or how it compares to other languages at <a href="compare">Compare</a>. 
</p>

<p> 
<strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong>
Creating a useful programming language is a big task.
Currently, my language is significantly less useful than the most commonly used ones.
If you want to get stuff done, you should look at those languages instead.
</p>

<p>
I think programming is very interesting.
It is also very complicated though. 
Why that is? 
Is programming complicated due to the languages we use?
Can we make it easier?
Since programming languages are the "user interface" for programming,
it seems a reasonable place to start investigating.
I made a programming language Goat to experiment with some ideas I have for making programming and programs easier to learn and to write.
In summary, some key ideas for Goat are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Easier to learn for programming</strong>
means a small core of concepts that interact in well-defined ways.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Easier to learn for programs</strong>
means readable code with precise meaning.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Easier to write for programming</strong>
means simple, flexible syntax,
and the ability to incrementally and interactively develop and combine ideas.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Easier to write for programs</strong>
means the ability to concisely express complex behaviour,
and reliable foundations to build on.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Goat is still a work in progress and it remains to be seen whether it will live up to these lofty ideals. :P
</p>

<p>
If you are familiar with other programming languages and want to see a quick comparison,
in <a href="compare">Compare</a> I attempt to describe how common patterns from other languages translate to Goat.
Don't worry if you're not familiar with other programming languages â€”
the combining forms of Goat are described thoroughly in their own terms in the <a href="learn">beginners introduction</a> and the <a href="examples">examples</a>.
If I've got you curious to know more, these are the places to go next.!
