<h1>Making a programming language</h1>

<p>
This article discusses the motivation I have for making a new programming language,
which I am calling <strong>Goat</strong>.
If you're looking to find out about the language itself,
some good places to start are the beginner's introduction at <a href="learn">Learn</a>,
or the <a href="examples">Examples</a>,
or how it compares to other languages at <a href="compare">Compare</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Languages are about communication.
For programming, this communication needs to be precise enough for the computer to follow,
and also readable enough for humans to make additions and fix errors.
Code is the written form of a programming language.
</p>

<p> 
Creating a useful programming language is a big task.
Currently, my language is significantly less useful than the most commonly used ones.
If you want to get stuff done, you should look at those languages instead.
However, programming languages are fascinating to study in their own right.
</p>

<p>
Along the same lines as human languages,
a programming language provides a set of primitive constructs and combining forms.
These forms are ways to put simple parts together to develop more complex behaviour.
The choices of primitives and combining forms of a programming language encourages a philosophical approach to writing programs.
</p>

<p>
One of the philosophical ideas guiding the design of Goat is that fewer concepts mean less to learn for a beginner and a uniform way to approach problems.
However, if the combining forms of a language are too simple,
expressing complex ideas can be cumbersome.
Goat aims for a balance between these concerns with powerful universal combining forms which can cover a wide variety of  use cases.
In addition, Goat sets out to help the programmer write reliable code with easily predictable behaviour and without crashes.
</p>

<p>
If you are familiar with other programming languages and want to see a quick comparison,
in <a href="compare">Compare</a> I attempt to describe how common patterns from other languages translate to Goat.
Don't worry if you're not familiar with other programming languages â€”
the combining forms of Goat are described thoroughly in their own terms in the <a href="learn">beginners introduction</a> and the <a href="examples">examples</a>.
If I've got you curious to know more, these are the places to go next.!
