<h1>Making a programming language</h1>

<p>
This article discusses my motivation for making <strong>Goat</strong>, 
a new programming language.
To find out about the language itself,
some good places to start are the beginner's introduction at <a href="learn">Learn</a>,
or the <a href="examples">Examples</a>. 
</p>

<p> 
<strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong>
Goat is very incomplete!
Creating a useful programming language is a big task.
Currently, the language is significantly less useful than the most commonly used ones
(and also many less commonly used ones).
If you want to get stuff done, you should look at those languages instead.
</p>

<p>
Computer programs are powerful tools for automation.
However, going about making a program is a complicated endeavour! 
I'm interested in exploring where this complexity comes from.
Is programming complicated due to the languages we use?
Can we make it easier?
Computers —
What do they do?
Do they do things?
Let's find out!
Since programming languages are the "user interface" for programming,
it seems a reasonable place to start investigating.
I made a programming language Goat to experiment with some ideas I have for making programming and programs easier to learn and to write.
In summary, Goat seeks to make it easier to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Learn programming</strong>: a small core of concepts with well-defined interactions that lets you quickly grasp the basics move onto higher level programming concepts.
<li>
<strong>Write programming</strong>: simple and flexible syntax that lets you write your ideas with minimal syntactic hurdles;
interactive program-writing tools that let you incrementally develop and test ideas.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Learn programs</strong>: readable syntax with precise meaning that lets you work out what a program does.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Write programs</strong>: modular programs with precise interfaces that let you abstract complex behaviour and build upon reliable foundations.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Goat is still a work in progress and it remains to be seen whether it will live up to these lofty ideals.
</p>

<p>
Learning Goat shouldn't require previous experience with other programming languages —
Goat is described thoroughly in its own terms in the <a href="learn">beginners introduction</a> and the <a href="examples">examples</a>.
If I've got you curious to know more, these are the places to go next!
