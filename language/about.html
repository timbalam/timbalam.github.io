<h1>Making a programming language</h1>

<h4>What's this about?</h4>

<p>
I have made a programming language. I haven't decided what to call it yet. The working name for the language is "my". 
</p>

<h4>What's a programming language?</h4>

<p>
We use computers for a wide array of tasks, in a wide variety of devices. We use PCs and mobile phones to browse the web for information, shop on-line and consume social media, we send and receive email, we read and  write documents, play games, and many other tasks. Computers can perform repetitive business operations and calculations quickly and automatically, allowing us to be more productive with our time. Programming languages are a form of communication that lets us describe how the computer should do these sorts of tasks. Code is the written form of a programming language, and can be read and executed by a computer program that understands the rules of the language. 
</p>

<h4>Aren't there already other programming languages? How is your language different?</h4>

<p>
Creating a useful programming language is a big task. Currently, my language is significantly less useful than the most commonly used ones. If you want to get stuff done, you should look at those languages instead. However, programming languages are fascinating to study in their own right. When we learn a programming language, we might focus on a primitive construct provided by the language, like a for-loop or a function, and how to do certain tasks with them, like counting grocery costs or manipulating text. Writing a new programming language lets me explore how one could program using an alternative set of constructs. The set of constructs is one way in which a programming language encourages a philosophical approach to writing programs.
</p>

<p>
Some of the philosophy guiding the design of my language is thus - that it should be reasonably obvious what code is going to do when it runs, and that there should be a reasonably obvious way to get something done. One way I have followed this principle is by limiting the number of primitive constructs provided by the language. Languages with a lot of constructs can give a programmer a lot of power, but can be difficult to learn and the interactions between constructs can lead to it being difficult to follow exactly how a program will work. An abundance of constructs can also lead to confusion about how to approach a problem. Two constructs that are provided by many common programming languages are functions, and objects, which are a handy way to organise functions for a common purpose. When using these languages I have often found it difficult to decide when an object is appropriate, or whether a function will do.
</p>

<p>
There exists programming languages that choose to only provide either only functions, or less commonly, only objects, and hence provide an obvious way to approach a task. An issue that can arise is that a small set of primitive constructs can be difficult to use, requiring one to reimplement some missing constructs, leading to more work to write a program, and more opportunities to make mistakes.
</p>

<p>
My language chooses to balance these concerns by providing a small number of powerful primitive structures, which can effectively cover use cases requiring many distinct constructs provided by other languages. If you are familiar with other programming languages and want to see a quick comparison, in <a href="compare">Compare</a> I attempt to describe how common constructs from other languages relate to these primitive constructs. Don't worry if you're not familiar with other programming languages! The constructs are described thoroughly in their own terms in the <a href="learn">beginners introduction</a> and the <a href="examples">examples</a>.
</p>

<h4>How do I use your language?</h4>

<p>
You can write my language code using any text editor. Currently, you will need to download my language's interpreter <code>myi</code>, and use the command line or terminal interface of your computer to run your program. For instructions for getting started see <a href="try">Try</a>.
