<h1>Making a programming language</h1>

<h4>What's this about?</h4>

<p>
I have made a programming language. I haven't decided what to call it yet. The working name for the language is "my". 
</p>

<h4>A what? What's a programming language?</h4>

<p>
A programming language lets us describe what we would like the computer to do. Code written in the programming language can be read and executed by a computer program that understands the rules of the language. 
</p>

<h4>Aren't there already other programming languages? How is my language different?</h4>

<p>
My language is different from other programming languages in that it seeks to keep the number of syntactic concepts low, centering on a simple yet powerful primitive structure. This directs toward some goals of my languauge - that it should be reasonably obvious what code is going to do, and that there should also be a reasonably obvious way to get something done. Hopefully this will be illustrated as we look at some examples.
</p>

<h4>How do I use my language?</h4>

<p>
We use a text editor to write our program code, and then give the text file to the <code>myi</code> program to execute. <code>myi</code> is short for <em>My interpreter</em> because it interprets the code you wrote based on the rules of my language. <code>myi</code> is run from the command line or terminal of your computer. To install <code>myi</code> and get started at <a href="try">Try</a>.
