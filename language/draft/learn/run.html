<h1>How to run a Goat program</h2>

<p>
We will start with a simple program to test that everything is working.
Shown in the other tab is the Goat <strong>Web Interpreter</strong>.
In the box below the title <strong>Editable code</strong> type in the following code block.
</p>

<pre>
myText = "Hello world.";
</pre>

<p>
Now, click on the box at the bottom below the title <strong>Output</strong> and type the following:
<pre>
myText
</pre>
and click the <strong>Evaluate</strong> button.
You should see the following printed to the <strong>Output</strong> area:
</p>

<pre>
>> myText
Hello world.
</pre>

<p>
Congratulations, you have made a Goat program!
</p>

<h4>How it looks and what it means</h4>

<p>
Learning to read Goat code means learning the code's syntax –
how programming concepts are represented as text.
In the following I will briefly describe the syntax and meaning of the code shown in the program above.
To begin, the first line shows our first example of syntax:
from the left we see first a sequence of alphabetic characters <code>myText</code> forming a word.
<pre>
myText = "Hello world.";
^^^^^^
</pre>
Next is a space, then an equals sign symbol <code>=</code>.
<pre>
myText = "Hello world.";
       ^
</pre>
Next is another space, then a sentence in double quotes <code>"Hello world."</code>.
<pre>
myText = "Hello world.";
         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</pre>
Finally, we have a semi-colon symbol <code>;</code>.
<pre>
myText = "Hello world.";
                       ^
</pre>
This combination of syntax demonstrates a very common form in my language, 
called an "assignment". 
We have seen the effect of using this form.
In the <strong>Evaluate</strong> box we typed a repetition of the label <code>myText</code>,
and evaluating this code resulted in the text "Hello world." being printed to the <strong>Output</strong> area.
</p> 

<p>
In general, the assignment form includes a left-hand side label –
<code>myText</code> in the example –
followed by a <code>=</code>,
and a right-hand side code definition –
<code>"Hello world."</code> in the example –
and finally a <code>;</code> terminator.
Spaces can appear between any of these parts – they are for the benefit of the reader and have no effect on the computed value.
Currently, Goat does not allow spaces within a left-hand side label.
</p>

<p>
Returning to the example,
the defining code on the right-hand side of the assignment is the double-quoted sentence <code>"Hello world."</code>.
This is our first example of a primitive form in Goat,
called "literal text" or just "text".
The form uses double-quotes around text to represent exactly the text shown within the quotes.
(Note that inside quotes, spaces are significant and not ignored!)
</p>

<p>
To sum up, 
with this assignment we are saying that whereever else we use the name <code>myText</code>,
we really mean the text "Hello world.". 
The assignment form lets you give names to reusable pieces of code,
and refer to a name within code definitions as shorthand for its definition.
This is how we get "Hello world." printed when we evaluated the label <code>myText</code> in the <strong>Evaluate</strong> box.
We can put any code definition into the <strong>Evaluate</strong> box and evaluate it to see for ourselves what happens.
