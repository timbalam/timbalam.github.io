<h1>Calculating with Goat</h1>

<p>
So, we have printed text to the screen with Goat. 
Cool! But Goat can calculate things too!
For our next exercise we will need another Goat pen. 
</p>

<textarea class="codebox" style="min-height: 100px; width: 95%"></textarea>

<p>
For this exercise we will consider the following example code.
</p>

<pre>
myNumber = 2;
myMath = 3 * myNumber;
.output = myMath;
</pre>

<p>
Type out (or copy) the code above into the web interpreter box. 
Upon navigating away from the box you should see the following printed below the box:
<pre>
6.0
</pre>
</p> 

<p>
As with the <a href="run">previous example</a>, 
careful study of the lines of code can help us to understand how the program arrived at this result. 
If you find you are getting lost in the following discussion, 
it might help to go back and have a closer look at the breakdown of the other example,
as there are many similarities. 
The first line is recognisably an assignment with left-hand side name <code>myNumber</code>
<pre>
1 | myNumber = 2;
    ^^^^^^^^
</pre>
and right-hand side of the number 2,
an example of a primitive form as mentioned <a href="run">here</a>. 
<pre>
1 | myNumber = 2;
               ^
</pre>
Recall that this assignment means that we are choosing the name <code>myNumber</code> to be equivalent to the number 2 where ever we use it in definition code. 
The second line is also an assignment, this time to the label <code>myMath</code>.
The right hand side
<pre>
2 | myMath = 3 * myNumber;
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^
</pre>
shows another primitive form - a mathematical expression, with the asterisk symbol <code>*</code> indicating a multiplication operation applied to the left and right inputs.
Essentially, this definition says to multiply the number 3 by the value of the code represented by <code>myNumber</code>. 
Here, the definition for <code>myNumber</code> comes from the assignment on the previous line.
</p>

<p>
The third line is where we define the magical <code>.output</code> label to be <code>myMath</code>,
allowing the web interpreter to evaluate and print it. 
<pre>
3 | .output = myMath;
</pre>
As you might expect, the interpreter finds the result to be the number 6.
