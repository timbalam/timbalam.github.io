<h1>Names, associated</h1>

<p>
A common feature in Goat programs,
which we will learn about in this tutorial,
are <em>tuples</em>,
where a set of association are made between names and code definitions.
Their usage is perhaps best demonstrated with an exercise.
Let's start with the Goat Pen below.
</p>

<textarea class="codebox"></textarea>

<p>
Let's imagine we have a two-dimensional co-ordinate that we want to inspect the y-axis component of. In Goat we can write some code like the following.
</p>

<pre class="codebox">
myPoint = (.x : 2, .y : 4);
.inspect = myPoint.y;
</pre>

<p>
As usual, I'll ask you to type the above code block into the Goat pen and run it. 
You should see the following.
</p>

<pre class="codebox-output">

</pre>


<h4>Creating tuples</h4> 

<p>
The right hand side of the <code>myPoint</code> assignment is a <em>tuple</em>.
This tuple associates the names <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> to numeric values representing the point's x- and y- co-ordinates.
The following diagram of the first line highlights the syntax for "declaring" a tuple.
</p>
<pre>
1 | myPoint = (.x : 2, .y : 4);
              ^      ^       ^
              1^^^^^^3 ^^^^^^1
               2       2
</pre>
<ol>
<li>
Tuple declarations start and end with a pair of <strong>parentheses</strong> <code>()</code>.
</li>
<li>
A tuple declaration involves a sequence of <em>associations</em>.
Associations use a <strong>colon</strong> symbol <code>:</code> to separate a left-hand side name and a right-hand side definition.
Each name of a association must be prefixed with <code>.</code>.
(We will see the reason for this in the next section.)
</li>
<li>
Associations are terminated by a comma symbol <code>,</code>.
Terminating the last definition is optional.
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Using tuples</h4>

<p>
In definition of <code>inspect</code> on the second line of our program,
we see how to access a component of a tuple â€“
the tuple definition represented by <code>myPoint</code> is followed by the same <code>.y</code> syntax used in the definition.
We have seen this evaluates to the corresponding definition in the <code>myPoint</code> tuple, 4.
In Goat, names defined with the <code>.</code> prefix within a tuple are able to be accessed in this manner,
and are called "components".
</p>


<h4>Missing names</h4>

<p>
It is an error to access a name that is not associated in the tuple.
To see this let's modify our program above so that we instead access a name "z" on <code>myPoint</code>.
Make the following change to the second line of our program in the Goat pen above.
</p>
<pre class="codebox">
.inspect = myPoint.z;
</pre>
<p>
After running, you should see the following printed below the box.
</p>
<pre class="codebox-output">
&lt;error: Missing component: z&gt;
</pre>
