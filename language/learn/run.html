<h1>Run a simple Goat program</h2>

<p>
In this first tutorial we will writing a simple program. 
This will firstly test that the <strong>Goat Web Interpreter</strong> is working,
and secondly demonstrate how to run a Goat program.
For this we will need the box below,
 called the <strong>Goat Pen</strong>.
As we will see,
text written in the Goat Pen can be evaluated by the Goat Web Interpreter.
</p>

<textarea class="codebox" style="min-height: 100px; width: 95%"></textarea>

<p>
Type the following code block into the Goat pen above.
Click outside the pen or press the tab key when you are finished.
</p>

<pre>
myText = "Hello darkness.";
.inspect = myText;
</pre>

<p>
If it worked correctly, you should see the following text appear below the box:
</p>

<pre>
Hello darkness.
</pre>

<p>
Congratulations, you have a working Goat program!
</p>

<h4>How it looks and what it means</h4>

<p>
The diagram below shows an annotated version of the program we just wrote,
with the main features of interest to the computer highlighted.
(Line numbers for the original program lines are shown on the far left.)
<pre>
1 | myText = "Hello darkness.";
    ^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    1      ^ 3                ^
           2                  4
2 | .inspect = myText;
    ^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^
    5        ^ 6     ^
             2       4
</pre>
<ol>
<li>
The computer understands sequences of alphabetic characters such as <code>myText</code> to be a name.
The space after isn't necessary but helps readability.
For the most part, spacing doesn't affect the meaning of the program.
Names are not allowed to contain spaces.
</li>
<li>
The computer sees the <strong>equals sign</strong> symbol <code>=</code> and understands that we are making an <em>assignment</em>.
The name to the left is defined as equivalent to the code to the right.
(Any space immediately after the <code>=</code> also has no effect on the program.)
</li>
<li>
The sentence in double quotes <code>"Hello darkness."</code> represents a literal text value. 
</li>
<li>
Each line ends with a <strong>semi-colon</strong> symbol <code>;</code>.
The <code>;</code> indicates that we have finished with the definition for an assignment.
</li>
<li>
The second line defines a special name <code>inspect</code> with a <strong>full stop</strong> symbol <code>.</code> prefix. 
If this name is defined (the prefix is necessary),
the Goat Pen will try to evaluate the definition and prints the result below the pen.
Otherwise, a default message will be displayed.
</li>
<li>
The name <code>myText</code> is assigned to <code>inspect</code>.
When used inside a definition,
a name is a place-holder for its definition.
As <code>myText</code> was assigned to be the text "Hello darkness.",
this is what <code>inspect</code> evaluates to,
and is thus printed below the Goat pen.
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h4>My first error</h4>

<p>
It is an error to use a label in a definition without giving a definition too.
Let's see what happens if we change the definition of <code>inspect</code> to an undefined label <code>myTekts</code>.
Go to the Goat pen above and change the second line to the following:
<pre>
.inspect = myTekts;
</pre>
You should see the following message following the Goat pen:
<pre>
&lt;error: Missing assignment: myTekts&gt;
</pre>
This way, if we might misspell or misremember a name,
Goat will let us know about it so we can fix it!
