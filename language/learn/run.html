<h1>Run a simple Goat program</h2>

<p>
The text in the box below will be evaluated by the Goat <strong>web interpreter</strong>.
</p>

<textarea class="codebox" style="min-height: 100px; width: 95%"></textarea>

<p>
We will start with a simple program to test that it is working,
and to see how to use it to run Goat programs.
In the box above type in the following code block.
Press the escape key or tab key when you are finished.
</p>

<pre>
myText = "Hello world.";
.output = myText;
</pre>

<p>
If it worked correctly, you should see the following text appear below the box:
</p>

<pre>
Hello world.
</pre>

<p>
Congratulations, you have a working Goat program!
</p>

<h4>How it looks and what it means</h4>

<p>
Learning to read Goat code means learning the code's syntax –
how programming concepts are represented as text.
In the following I will briefly describe the syntax and meaning of the code shown in the program above.
To begin, the first line shows our first example of syntax:
from the left we see first a sequence of alphabetic characters <code>myText</code> forming a word.
<pre>
myText = "Hello world.";
^^^^^^
</pre>
Next is a space, then an equals sign symbol <code>=</code>.
<pre>
myText = "Hello world.";
       ^
</pre>
Next is another space, then a sentence in double quotes <code>"Hello world."</code>.
<pre>
myText = "Hello world.";
         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</pre>
Finally, we have a semi-colon symbol <code>;</code>.
<pre>
myText = "Hello world.";
                       ^
</pre>
This combination of syntax demonstrates a very common form in my language, 
called an "assignment". 
We have seen the effect of using this form.
In the <strong>Evaluate</strong> box we typed a repetition of the label <code>myText</code>,
and evaluating this code resulted in the text "Hello world." being printed to the <strong>Output</strong> area.
</p> 

<p>
In general, the assignment form includes a left-hand side label –
<code>myText</code> in the example –
followed by a <code>=</code>,
and a right-hand side code definition –
<code>"Hello world."</code> in the example –
and finally a <code>;</code> terminator.
Spaces can appear between any of these parts – they are for the benefit of the reader and have no effect on the computed value.
Currently, Goat does not allow spaces within a left-hand side label.
</p>

<p>
Returning to the example,
the defining code on the right-hand side of the assignment is the double-quoted sentence <code>"Hello world."</code>.
This is our first example of a primitive form in Goat,
called "literal text" or just "text".
The form uses double-quotes around text to represent exactly the text shown within the quotes.
(Note that inside quotes, spaces are significant and not ignored!)
</p>

<p>
To sum up, 
with this assignment we are saying that whereever else we use the name <code>myText</code>,
we really mean the text "Hello world.". 
The assignment form lets you give names to reusable pieces of code,
and refer to a name within code definitions as shorthand for its definition.
This is how we get "Hello world." printed when we evaluated the label <code>myText</code> in the <strong>Evaluate</strong> box.
We can put any code definition into the <strong>Evaluate</strong> box and evaluate it to see for ourselves what happens.
