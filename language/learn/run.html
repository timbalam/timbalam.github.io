<h1>Run a simple Goat program</h2>

<p>
We will start by writing a simple program. 
This will firstly test that the <strong>Goat web interpreter</strong> is working,
and secondly demonstrate how to run a Goat program.
For this we will need the box below,
 called the <strong>Goat pen</strong>.
As we will see,
text written in the Goat pen can be evaluated by the Goat web interpreter.
</p>

<textarea class="codebox" style="min-height: 100px; width: 95%"></textarea>

<p>
Type the following code block into the Goat pen above.
Click outside the pen or press the tab key when you are finished.
</p>

<pre>
myText = "Hello world.";
.output = myText;
</pre>

<p>
If it worked correctly, you should see the following text appear below the box:
</p>

<pre>
Hello world.
</pre>

<p>
Congratulations, you have a working Goat program!
</p>

<h4>How it looks and what it means</h4>

<p>
The diagram below shows how the computer deconstructs the program we just wrote.
(Line numbers for the original program lines are shown on the far left.)
<p>
<pre>
1 | myText = "Hello world.";
    ^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    1      ^ 3             ^
           2               4
2 | .output = myText;
    ^       ^       ^
    5^^^^^^ 2 ^^^^^^4
     6        7
</pre>
<p>
<ol>
<li><p>
The computer understands sequences of alphabetic characters such as <code>myText</code> to be a name.
The space at the end helps readability but is not necessary and doesn't change the meaning of the program.
Names are not allowed to contain spaces.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The computer sees the equals sign symbol <code>=</code> and understands that we are making an <em>assignment</em>.
The name to the left is defined as equivalent to the code to the right. Any space immediately after the <code>=</code> also has no effect on the program.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The sentence in double quotes <code>"Hello world."</code> represents a literal text value. 
</p></li>
<li><p>
Each line ends with a semi-colon symbol <code>;</code>.
The <code>;</code> indicates that we have finished with the definition for an assignment.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The second line, shown below, begins with a full-stop symbol <code>.
</code>.
The <code>.</code> indicates that the following name has a special meaning. 
In this case, it allows the Goat web interpreter to read and evaluate the definition of <code>output</code>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The Goat pen is set up so that the definition made for <code>output</code> is evaluated and the result printed below the pen.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The name <code>myText</code> is assigned to <code>output</code>.
When used inside a definition,
a name is a place-holder for its definition.
It is an error to use an undefined label on the right hand side of an assignment.
As <code>myText</code> was assigned to be the text "Hello world.",
this is what <code>output</code> evaluates to,
and is thus printed below the Goat pen.
