<h1>Run a simple Goat program</h2>

<p>
The text in the box below will be evaluated by the Goat <strong>web interpreter</strong>.
</p>

<textarea class="codebox" style="min-height: 100px; width: 95%"></textarea>

<p>
We will start with a simple program to test that it is working,
and to see how to use it to run Goat programs.
In the box above type in the following code block.
Click outside the box or press the tab key when you are finished.
</p>

<pre>
myText = "Hello world.";
.output = myText;
</pre>

<p>
If it worked correctly, you should see the following text appear below the box:
</p>

<pre>
Hello world.
</pre>

<p>
Congratulations, you have a working Goat program!
</p>

<h4>How it looks and what it means</h4>

<p>
In this part we will deconstruct the simple program we just wrote.
This is a bit of a look at the program from the computer's perspective
(technically the perspective of the Goat interpreter, which is a computer program).
Like several notable human languages, the computer reads from left to right.
We begin with the first word of the first line, highlighted below (where I have added a line number marker):
<pre>
1 | myText = "Hello world.";
    ^^^^^^
</pre>
The computer understands sequences of alphabetic characters such as <code>myText</code> to be a name.
Next is a space.
Spaces can increase readability for humans, but they don't matter to the computer!
An exception to this that we should note is that names are currently not allowed to contain spaces. 
After the space is an equals sign symbol <code>=</code>:
<pre>
1 | myText = "Hello world.";
           ^
</pre>
The computer sees the <code>=</code> character and understands that we are making an <em>assignment</em>.
The name to the left is being defined as equivalent to the code to the right. 
Next is another (ignored) space, then a sentence in double quotes <code>"Hello world."</code>.
<pre>
1 | myText = "Hello world.";
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</pre>
Finally, we have a semi-colon symbol <code>;</code>.
<pre>
1 | myText = "Hello world.";
                           ^
</pre>
The <code>;</code> character indicates that we have finished with the definition for the assignment.
The content of the definition is the double-quoted sentence <code>"Hello world."</code>.
This is an example of a <em>primitive</em> form in Goat,
for which the Goat interpreter has built-in knowledge.
</p>

<p>
The second line, shown below, begins with a period symbol <code>.</code>:
<pre>
2 | .output = myText;
    ^
</pre>
followed by the word <code>output</code>:
<pre>
2 | .output = myText;
     ^^^^^^
</pre>
The <code>.</code> as giving special meaning to whichever word follows it.
In this case, it allows the Goat web interpreter to read, evaluate, and print the definition we give to the word <code>output</code>.
The line continues with <code>=</code>,
following the assignment pattern which we saw in the first line.
In this case the assigned code is a repetition of <code>myText</code>:
<pre>
2 | .output = myText;
              ^^^^^^
</pre>
The Goat web interpreter is set up to look for the definition of <code>output</code>,
and to print the result of evaluating the definition below the input text box.
As we assigned the name <code>myText</code> to be the text "Hello world." on the first line,
this is what our program prints.
</p> 

<p>
We can expand on the concept of a primitive form a bit.
This example features a double-quoted sentence,
called "literal text" or just "text".
The form uses double-quotes around text to represent exactly the text shown within the quotes.
(Note that inside quotes, spaces are significant and not ignored!)
Some more examples of a primitive form are literal numbers –
represented by numeric characters e.g. <code>11</code>, <code>0.45</code> –
and some mathematical operations –
represented by infix symbolic characters e.g. <code>+</code>, <code>/</code>.
We will see demonstrations of these primitive in the next example.
