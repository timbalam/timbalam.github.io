<h1>Run a simple Goat program</h2>

<p>
In this first tutorial we will writing a simple program. 
This will firstly test that the <strong>Goat Web Interpreter</strong> is working,
and secondly demonstrate how to run a Goat program.
For this we will need the box below,
 called the <strong>Goat Pen</strong>.
As we will see,
text written in the Goat Pen can be evaluated by the Goat Web Interpreter.
</p>

<textarea class="codebox" style="min-height: 100px; width: 95%"></textarea>

<p>
Type the following code block into the Goat pen above.
Click outside the pen or press the tab key when you are finished.
</p>

<pre>
myText = "Hello world.";
.output = myText;
</pre>

<p>
If it worked correctly, you should see the following text appear below the box:
</p>

<pre>
Hello world.
</pre>

<p>
Congratulations, you have a working Goat program!
</p>

<h4>How it looks and what it means</h4>

<p>
The diagram below shows an annotated version of the program we just wrote,
with the main features of interest to the computer highlighted.
(Line numbers for the original program lines are shown on the far left.)
<p>
<pre>
1 | myText = "Hello world.";
    ^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    1      ^ 3             ^
           2               4
2 | .output = myText;
    ^       ^       ^
    5^^^^^^ 2 ^^^^^^4
     6        7
</pre>
<p>
<ol>
<li><p>
The computer understands sequences of alphabetic characters such as <code>myText</code> to be a name.
The space at the end helps readability but is not necessary and doesn't change the meaning of the program.
Names are not allowed to contain spaces.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The computer sees the equals sign symbol <code>=</code> and understands that we are making an <em>assignment</em>.
The name to the left is defined as equivalent to the code to the right. Any space immediately after the <code>=</code> also has no effect on the program.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The sentence in double quotes <code>"Hello world."</code> represents a literal text value. 
</p></li>
<li><p>
Each line ends with a semi-colon symbol <code>;</code>.
The <code>;</code> indicates that we have finished with the definition for an assignment.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The second line, shown below, begins with a full-stop symbol <code>.
</code>.
The <code>.</code> indicates that the following name has a special meaning. 
In this case, it allows the Goat web interpreter to read and evaluate the definition of <code>output</code>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The Goat pen is set up so that the definition made for <code>output</code> is evaluated and the result printed below the pen.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The name <code>myText</code> is assigned to <code>output</code>.
When used inside a definition,
a name is a place-holder for its definition.
As <code>myText</code> was assigned to be the text "Hello world.",
this is what <code>output</code> evaluates to,
and is thus printed below the Goat pen.
</p></li>
</ol>

<h4>My first error</h4>

<p>
It is an error to use a label in a definition without giving a definition too.
Let's see what happens if we change the definition of <code>output</code> to an undefined label <code>myTekts</code>.
Go to the Goat pen above and change the second line to the following:
<pre>
.output = myTekts;
</pre>
[#TODO] You should see the following message following the Goat pen:
<pre>
error: definition missing: "myTekts"
</pre>
This way, if we might misspell or misremember a name,
Goat will let us know about it so we can fix it!
