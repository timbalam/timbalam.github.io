<h1>Run a simple Goat program</h1>

<p>
In this first tutorial we will write and run a simple program.
</p>

<p>
We will use the box below,
called the <strong>Goat Pen</strong>.
As we will see,
the Goat Pen can evaluate Goat <strong>code</strong> written in it.
</p>

<textarea class="codebox"></textarea>
<pre class="codebox-output" hidden></pre>

<p>
The box following contains some Goat code.
Type the code into the Goat pen above.
<strong>Click outside the pen</strong> or <strong>press the tab key</strong> when you are finished.
</p>

<pre class="codebox">
message = "Hello darkness.";
.inspect = message;
</pre>

<p>
If it worked correctly, you should see the following text appear below the box:
</p>

<pre class="codebox-output">
Something's not working...
</pre>

<p>
Congratulations,
you have made a working Goat program!
</p>

<h2>How it looks and what it means</h2>

<p>
A Goat <em>program</em> structure is inspired by that of a dictionary.
In the simplest form,
a program describes a vocabulary â€”
a series of <em>words</em> and their corresponding <em>definitions</em>.
</p>

<p>
Our program defines two words,
with the form <em>word</em> <code>=</code> <em>definition</em> <code>;</code>.
On the first line,
<code>message</code> is defined as the piece of text "Hello, darkness.".
</p>

<p>
On the second line,
<code>inspect</code> is defined.
The word <code>inspect</code>
is written with a <em>prefix</em> period character <code>.</code>.
We will see the significance of this below and in later tutorials.
</p>

<p>
<code>inspect</code> is defined effectively as a synonym for <code>message</code>,
demonstrating that Goat,
like a dictionary,
allows words to be defined in terms of other words. 
</p>

<p>
We make this synonym for a good reason,
because <code>inspect</code> is a privledged word inside the Goat Pen.
When made with the <code>.</code> prefix,
the word <code>inspect</code> defines the <strong>value that is displayed in the output box</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Since <code>inspect</code> is a synonym for <code>message</code>,
and <code>message</code> is a piece of text,
we end up seeing that text displayed:
"Hello, darkness.".
</p>

<h2>New syntax</h2>

<p>
In this tutorial we have encountered our first example of Goat code.
Let's summarise:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
A <em>program</em> is a series of <em>word</em>-<em>definition</em> pairs.
<li>
An equals sign <code>=</code> is used between a word being defined and its definition.
The end of the definition is indicated by a semi-colon character <code>;</code>.
</li><li>
A word can contain letters and numbers and must start with a letter.
Spaces or symbols are not allowed in words.
</li><li>
A fragment of <em>literal text</em> can be represented by surrounding it with double quote characters <code>"</code>.
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Discover</h4>

<p>
Below is a list of additional facts and exercises for those who wish to learn more about Goat syntax.
For the exercises, utilise the Goat Pen at the top of the article. 
(Remember to press tab or click outside of the box after making the changes).
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The example code in this tutorial uses white space (spaces and newlines) to improve readability.
In fact, space can be added almost anywhere without changing the program behaviour.
Delete all of the spaces and newlines in the example exercise.
</li><li>
Next, add back in any spaces or newlines you like.
Can you produce an error?
</li><li>
One place that spaces are forbidden is in words.
Add a space in <code>message</code>.
(This should give an error!)
</li><li>
The definition of <code>message</code> in line 1 uses a literal text.
Change the text inside the <code>"</code>'s.
</li>
<li>
The definition of <code>inspect</code> makes reference to another defined word <code>message</code>.
Modify the definition of <code>inspect</code> to be an undefined word, e.g. <code>messge</code>.
(Should give another error!)
Note that if we misspell or misremember a word we defined,
Goat will let us know so we can fix it.
