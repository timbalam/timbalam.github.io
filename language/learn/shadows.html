<h1>Regarding precedence</h1>

<p>
In the <a href="names">previous tutorial</a> we mentioned how the block declaration introduces a nested layer of names,
permitted to overlap with outer layers.
In this tutorial we will investigate how layers of names created by blocks interact with outer layer of names.
For this we will need our Goat Pen:
</p>

<textarea class="codebox"></textarea>

<p>
Let's modify the example from the other tutorial,
and instead define <code>x</code> locally, above the first line,
as shown below.
</p>

<pre class="codebox">
x = 1;
myLine = { .y = x + 2 };
.inspect = myLine.y;
</pre>

<p>
Typing this into the Goat Pen and running should get us the following result:
</p>

<pre class="codebox-output">
3.0
</pre>

<p>
For the second part of our investigation,
we are going to add back the <code>x</code> definition to <code>myLine</code>.
With this change, our program becomes:
</p>

<pre class="codebox">
x = 1;
myLine = { .x = 2; .y = x + 2 };
.inspect = myLine.y;
</pre>

<p>
What will the value of <code>myLine.y</code> turn out to be?
Type the new program into the Goat Pen to find out.
You should see this.
</p>

<pre class="codebox-output">
4.0
</pre>

<p>
This result is the same as the program from other tutorial,
and demonstrates how Goat decides what definitions to give to names.
The definition for "x" made inside the block definition overrides
the definition made on the first line of the program.
For Goat program the following holds:
<strong>Names assigned in a block take precedence over (or "shadow") any identical names defined in layers outside the block.</strong>
The value represented by a name used in a definition hence comes
from the closest surrounding layer where it is given a definition.
