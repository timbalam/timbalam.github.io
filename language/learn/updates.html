<h4>Names, updated</h4>

<p>
In the <a href="layers">Layers</a> tutorial we set out to represent a line by a generalised point with interdependent x- and y- components.
We got as far as the following definition for <code>myPoint</code>:
</p>
<pre>
myPoint = {.x = 2; .y = x + 2};
</pre>
<p>
This is close! The only thing we would need to be able to do is to adjust the value of the x-component,
and have the y-component automatically update to match.
In fact, as this tutorial will show,
Goat has exactly this feature.
We will need the following Goat Pen.
</p>
<textarea class="codebox"></textarea>

<p>
Here is some code demonstrating the Goat's ability to "update" a block' definitions.
</p>
<pre class="codebox">
myPoint = {.x = 2; .y = x + 2};
myPoint2 = myPoint(.x : 5);
.inspect = myPoint2.y;
</pre>

<p>
Go ahead and try it in the Goat Pen. You should see the following.
</p>
<pre class="codebox-output">
7.0
</pre>

<h4>Component-wise update</h4>

<p>
The second line of the above program demonstrates Goat's block update syntax.
The value assigned to <code>myPoint2</code> is a modified version of <code>myPoint</code> that incorporating a new definition for its "x" component.
Here we reproduce the line and highlight the main parts of the syntax.
</p>
<pre>
2 | myPoint2 = myPoint(.x : 5);
               ^^^^^^^
               1      ^^^^^^^^
                      2
</pre>
<ol>
<li>
The value to be modified comes first, here <code>myPoint</code> as defined on the first line.
</li>
<li>
Directly following is a tuple or block declaration with components to be updated or added to the old value.
Here the "x" component is being redefined as <code>5</code>.
As running the code shows,
the corresponding value for the y-coordinate is also updated to 7.
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Fun with lines</h4>

<p>
We can see that our generalised definition of <code>myPoint</code> can really describe a line.
We can update the "x" component with a series of intervals and invoke the "y" component to find out the corresponding height of the line.
Try adjusting our code to update <code>myPoint</code> with different values of "x" in the Goat Pen!
