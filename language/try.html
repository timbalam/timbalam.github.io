<h1>Getting started with my language</h1>

<h4>The easy way (on Windows at least):</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Download the binary for the latest <a href="https://github.com/timbalam/myi/releases">GitHub release</a> to your usual download folder.
</li>
<li>
Open the file explorer program on your computer and navigate to the folder with the downloaded archive. Right-click and unpack the archive and place the contained file <code>myi-exe.exe</code> somewhere, for example in your home directory, 'Documents' directory, or a create a new folder.
</li>
<li>
Open the command prompt or terminal interface on your computer, type <code>cd</code> followed by the path to the directory where you placed <code>myi-exe.exe</code>, and hit 'enter'. 
</li>
<li>
Alternatively, place <code>myi-exe.exe</code> in a directory mentioned in your <code>%PATH%</code> (to see a list of directories, type <code>echo %PATH%</code> and hit 'enter').
</li>
<li>
To test that the my language interpreter is installed correctly, you can type <code>myi-exe.exe --version</code> and hit 'enter'. If you see something like: <code>myi-exe.EXE: --version: openFile: does not exist (No such file or directory)</code> then congratulations! It works! If you see something like: <code>'mye-exe.exe' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.'</code>, unfortunately something hasn't worked. Perhaps try the alternative way below. 
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Alternative way</h4>
<p>
If easy way doesn't work, or you want to play with it, you can build the source code:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
You will need to <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install">install Stack</a> on your system.
</li>
<li>
If you have <a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a> installed, you can use the command prompt or terminal command to clone the <code>myi</code> git repository (containing the program source code). Type <code>git clone https://github.com/timbalam/myi</code> and hit 'enter' to copy the repository folder to the current directory.
</li>
<li>
Alternatively you can obtain the git repository using a web browser with the following steps:
<ul>
<li>
Open a web browser, visit <a href="https://github.com/timbalam/myi">https://github.com/timbalam/myi</a> and select the green "Clone or download" button to the far right of the screen.
</li>
<li>
Press "Download ZIP" and save the archive to your usual downloads folder.
</li>
<li>
Find the downloaded archive in your file explorer program. Right-click and unpack the archive and place the source folder somewhere (e.g. your home directory, 'Documents' directory, or create a new directory).
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Either way, navigate to the source folder in the command prompt or terminal interface. Type <code>cd</code> followed by the path to the source folder, and hit 'enter'.
</li>
<li>
Type <code>stack build</code> and hit 'enter' to build the source. If Stack is successful you should eventually see a message like: 
<pre>
myi-0.1.0.0: copy/register
...
Installing executable(s) in
...
Registering myi-1.0.0...
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Writing and running your code</h4>
<p>
You can write your code in any text file editor, as long as it can save files in plain text format. For example <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> is a good option if you use Windows, and another is <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> which is available on most operating systems. Open the text editor, type your code, and save the file in the same directory that you installed <code>myi-exe.exe</code>.
</p>

<p>
To interpret the code, return to your terminal or command line prompt and type 
<code>myi-exe.exe</code> followed by the name you used to save your code file and hit 'enter'. If you installed via Stack (the 'Alternative way' above), you will need to
type <code>stack exec myi-exe --</code> (don't forget the two '-' dash characaters) follwed by the name of your saved code file, and hit 'enter'.
